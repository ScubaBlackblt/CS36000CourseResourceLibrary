Download the local database here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=516927

Just follow the youtube video below and make sure you are in the place where mysql.exe is
and as a test put the database name as world, it is a test database apart of the package you download
This is an example path that you can use as a reference: C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

Follow this video to connect MySQL database to VScode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzdCpJY6Y4c

After finishing video run this line of code in an MySQL connection to create the database:
CREATE DATABASE courseResourceLibrary;

After this is done, modify the connection from the test database 'world' to 'courseResourceLibrary' by right clicking on the connection in the top left when
connections are selected and select edit connection. Then change the Database field to 'courseResourceLibrary' and select save connection.

Run the TableSetup SQL code to set up the tables, and then the DatabaseTestData to make sure it is setup correctly.
